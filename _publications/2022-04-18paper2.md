title: "The Influencing Factors of Retro-Cue Effect in Visual Working Memory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-04-18paper2
excerpt: 'The visual working memory is a temporary storage system, which encodes, maintains and retrieves visual information. The researchers have found that adding retro-cues to the maintenance phase of memory leads to changes in participants’ memory performance, which is the retro-cue effect. The magnitude of the retro-cue effect is not set in stone, but changes with the changes of its influencing factors. However, there is no study to summarize the influencing factors of the retro-clue effect. This paper looked into the articles related to the study of the retro-cue effect and summarized the influencing factors of the retro-cue effect: memory items, maintenance interval time, interference in maintenance interval, and types of retro-cue. Based on this, future research can explore the factors that influence the retro-cue effect in other dimensions. At the same time, since retro-cue can improve memory performance and cognitive processing, these influencing factors should be reasonably controlled when using retro-cues. The internal attention mechanism of visual working memory could be further explored and the understanding of visual working memory mechanism could be promoted.'
